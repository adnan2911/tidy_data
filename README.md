Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
The data set has extracts of measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurements after merging training and test sets. The final data set has average of each activity and each subject

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- A 88 -feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'codebook.docx': Shows information about the variables used.

- 'tidy_data.txt': Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- 'run_analysis.R': Script to calculate above tidy data set


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
